      The Intersection Observer API provides a way to asynchronously observe changes in 
      the intersection of a target element with an ancestor 
      element or with a top-level document's viewport.

      Historically, detecting visibility of an element, 
      or the relative visibility of 
      two elements in relation to each other, 
      has been a difficult task for 
      which solutions have been unreliable 
      and prone to causing the browser and the sites the user is accessing to become sluggish. As the web has matured, the need for this kind of information has grown. Intersection information is needed for many reasons, such as:

      Lazy-loading of images or other content as a page is scrolled.
      Implementing "infinite scrolling" web sites, where more and more content is loaded and rendered as you scroll, so that the user doesn't have to flip through pages.
      Reporting of visibility of advertisements in order to calculate ad revenues.
      Deciding whether or not to perform tasks or animation processes based on whether or not the user will see the result.
      Implementing intersection detection in the past involved event handlers and loops calling methods like Element.getBoundingClientRect() to build up the needed information for every element affected. Since all this code runs on the main thread, even one of these can cause performance problems. When a site is loaded with these tests, things can get downright ugly.

      Consider a web page that uses infinite scrolling. It uses a vendor-provided library to manage the advertisements placed periodically throughout the page, has animated graphics here and there, and uses a custom library that draws notification boxes and the like. Each of these has its own intersection detection routines, all running on the main thread. The author of the web site may not even realize this is happening, since they may know very little about the inner workings of the two libraries they are using. As the user scrolls the page, these intersection detection routines are firing constantly during the scroll handling code, resulting in an experience that leaves the user frustrated with the browser, the web site, and their computer.

      Intersection observer concepts and usage
The Intersection Observer API allows you to configure a callback that is called:

(1) whenever one element, called the target, intersects either the device viewport or a specified element; for the purpose of this API, this is called the root element or root

(2) and whenever the observer is asked to watch a target for the very first time

Typically, you'll want to watch for intersection changes with regard to the element's closest scrollable ancestor, or, if the element isn't a descendant of a scrollable element, the viewport. To watch for intersection relative to the root element, specify null.

Whether you're using the viewport or some other element as the root, the API works the same way, executing a callback function you provide whenever the visibility of the target element changes so that it crosses desired amounts of intersection with the root.

The degree of intersection between the target element and its root is the intersection ratio. This is a representation of the percentage of the target element which is visible as a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
